# Wiki-RESTful-API

A Node.js app providing a basic RESTful API built from scratch.

It looks like a Wikipedia without having a frontend. You can add your custom data as a start point and manipulate your the mongoose database with API requests.

## Getting Started

First of all, clone the repository into your local machine.

Execute the following line to install all of the required packages:

```
npm install
```

You can use <a href="https://www.postman.com/">Postman</a> to test the API commands.
